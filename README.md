This is my solution for “Social links profile” of Frontend Mentor. I hope you like it and if you have any advice, I will appreciate it, I'm just starting in this programming and web design thing hahahaha.  Anyway, I hope you like it and to those who like me, feel a little frustrated with your first project, don't give up. Just take it easy and you will see how everything slowly comes together. Break a leg, or I guess in this case it would be a finger hahahaha!
